    "The best regression metric to use in this situation would be the Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE is a measure of how close the predicted values are to the actual values. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of predicting house price, MSE is a good metric to use because it takes into account the magnitude of the errors. For example, if the predicted house price is $100,000 and the actual house price is $95,000, then the error is $5,000. However, if the predicted house price is $10,000 and the actual house price is $5,000, then the error is also $5,000. MSE will penalize the larger error more than the smaller error, which is what we want in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other regression metrics that could be used include the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). RMSE is similar to MSE, but it takes the square root of the MSE, which makes it easier to interpret. MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values. MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE or RMSE, but it is not as good at taking into account the magnitude of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I would recommend using MSE as the regression metric. MSE is a good metric to use when the errors are normally distributed and when the magnitude of the errors is important. The house price dataset that you linked to seems to be normally distributed, and the magnitude of the errors is important in this case. Therefore, MSE is a good choice for the regression metric."

    "MSE directly measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller errors.

This is aligned with the goal of predicting the actual price of a house as accurately as possible.\n",

    "R-squared (R²) measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the regression model. While R² provides an indication of how well the model fits the data, it does not provide information about the magnitude or direction of errors. A high R² value does not necessarily mean that the model accurately predicts the actual prices of houses. It only indicates how much of the variance in the target variable is captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of predicting house prices accurately, minimizing the MSE would be more appropriate. It focuses directly on reducing prediction errors and ensures that the model is optimized for accuracy rather than simply explaining the variance in the target variable."

    "\n",
    "Here's why MAE is suitable for handling datasets with outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to other metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which square the differences. By taking the absolute differences, MAE does not overly penalize outliers and provides a more robust measure of the average prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can heavily influence metrics like MSE or RMSE, as they contribute squared errors that can skew the overall evaluation. This can result in misleading or inaccurate assessments of the model's performance. MAE, on the other hand, treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude, making it less influenced by outliers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretability: MSE and RMSE have different interpretations due to the square root operation in RMSE. MSE represents the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, while RMSE represents the square root of MSE and is in the same units as the target variable. If you prioritize interpretability and want the error metric in the original units of the target variable, you may choose RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: RMSE is more sensitive to outliers compared to MSE because it squares the errors before taking the square root. If your dataset has outliers and you want to give more weight to their influence on the overall error metric, RMSE may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnitude of Errors: If the magnitudes of errors in your predictions are of specific importance, MSE might be more suitable. MSE provides a direct measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, which can be meaningful in certain applications.\n",
